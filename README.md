# 10.6_destructuring


Software engineering and Development requires working with arrays and objects every day. One thing you'll want to do in this daily work is extract values from these data structures. Before ES2015, the code for this was quite tedious to implement, so a new feature was introduced called destructuring. 

 

In this subunit, you'll learn how to use destructuring to easily unpack values from a variety of objects, functions, arrays, and nested data structures. You'll see how destructuring can be used to swap values in arrays, and at the end of the subunit, you'll have a few exercises to get some hands-on practice.
